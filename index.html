<h2>Stances</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you have no active target your damage taken is calculated on defensive mode. This means you can block an attack as if on defensive stance before returning an attack on offensive stance.</li>
<li>If you untarget a monster after attacking you will need to wait 2 seconds for the passive defence mode to reactivate.</li>
<li>You can combine this with stairhopping to only take damage on defence mode. This is particularly useful on low skilled knights, paladins with spears.</li>
<li>Mages can use this to use their melee weapons while hunting with runes which has the dual advantage of killing weak monsters for free and allowing your shielding skill to progress.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t underestimate the power of the 1.8x multiplier on defensive mode. For example a mage on defence mode with MMS and 25 skill will block as much as a 88 skill knight blockig with MMS on offence mode or giant sword on balance mode.</li>
</ul>
