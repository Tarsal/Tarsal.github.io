<h1>Tibia 7.4/ Tibiantis notes</h1>
<p><i>by Tarsal.</i></p>
<p>This site is to share some articles on Tibia 7.4.</p>
<h2>Stances</h2>

<ul>
<li>When you have no active target your damage taken is calculated on defensive mode. This means you can block an attack as if on defensive stance before returning an attack on offensive stance.</li>
<li>If you untarget a monster after attacking you will need to wait 2 seconds for the passive defence mode to reactivate.</li>
<li>You can combine this with stairhopping to only take damage on defence mode. This is particularly useful on low skilled knights, paladins with spears.</li>
<li>Mages can use this to use their melee weapons while hunting with runes which has the dual advantage of killing weak monsters for free and allowing your shielding skill to progress.</li>
<li>Don’t underestimate the power of the 1.8x multiplier on defensive mode. For example a mage on defence mode with MMS and 25 skill will block as much as a 88 skill knight blockig with MMS on offence mode or giant sword on balance mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ranged units</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t target ranged units while chasing until you reach them as your shield will block ranged attacks as if on defence mode.</li>
<li>EvP ranged attacks count towards your shielding counter and break your shielding. For example if you take two melee hits and then a ranged attack within a 2 second turn, the ranged attack will bypass shielding for extra damage. For this reason orc spearmen are often left to flee on red hp as occasional shield breaks vs orc berserkers can be painful!</li>
<li>PvE and PvP ranged accounts don’t get blocked by shielding and don’t count towards your shielding break.</li>
<li>Ranged attacks count as spells and can are affected by a bug where the cooldown/ chance to hit is reset with each step (TBC). This can lead to a flurry of hits.</li>
<li>Ranged unit slow down when you are adjacent.</li>
</ul>
